# _Jon's Contact List Code Review_

#### By _**Jon Nardine**_

## Description

_This is Jon Nardine's first PHP code review, which will test his ability to use PHP, Twig, and Silex. The site will allow the user to generate a new contact using a form, and then display all created contacts in a list below the contact entry form. There is also a delete button which will clear the contacts list._

## Setup

_Please visit this website:_

http://jwnardine.github.io/PHPCodeReviewOne

Once you've cloned the repository, you will need to open up to the command prompt and find the /PHPCodeReviewOne folder.

Once you've found the folder, use the prompt __composer install__. This will set up the correct dependencies for your computer.

## Technologies Used

_PHP, Twig, Silex, Markdown, Github_
